import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

## Overview

The project is created to experiment with different approaches to use
React and create a list of do's, dont's, problematic approaches and best
practice in terms of performance, readability, extensibility and
maintainability.

### Note about `React.memo`

Using `React.memo` is useful for cases where you have a component that should be **re-rendered rarely**,
but is expensive to render. There is still some cost of using `React.memo` and it might be problematic,
if abused in a large app.

### Components

Examples of misusing the <Link to="/components">components</Link> paradigm and how to avoid unwanted re-rendering
and make application more robust and maintainable.

### Hooks

A set of techniques to leverage the power of <Link to="/hooks">hooks</Link> without introducing performance issues.

### Context

<Link to="/context">Context</Link> is powerful concept, but if you don't follow the
best practices how to use it, it leads to a massive ammount of the entire components
Tree re-rendering. This section describes how to avoid such situations.

### Immutability

It explains an <Link to="/immutability">immutability</Link> concept and why it is important, when using React.

### Links

The <Link to="/links">links</Link> to the tools, articles about performance and best practices can be found under this section.
