## Components

[`React.Component`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) encapsulates [State and Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html).

There are few types o the components available in React:

- **Class Component** - the component which extends [`React.Component`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactcomponent) and uses OOP paradigms to handle state, properties, actions and manage component lifecycle. React component re-renders if the parent component got re-rendered even if no props were changed.
- **Pure Component** - the [`React.PureComponent`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent) is similar to the `React.Component`. The difference between them is that `React.Component` doesnâ€™t implement `shouldComponentUpdate()`, but `React.PureComponent` implements it with a **shallow prop and state comparison**.
- **Function Component** - the [`React.FunctionComponent`](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components) is the component which takes props and renders them based on internal component logic.
- **Method Component** - the <Link to="/method-component">Method Component</Link> is the component which is defined as a method of class or as a function.

### Regular components no props change

If there is no any additional work on the child components done the `Class` and `Function` children components will re-render even if **no properties have been changed**.

As `Pure` component implements shallow comparison of the props out of the box, it won't re-render.

<Components isMemoized={false} changeProps={false} />

### Regular components props change

If **any prop has been changed** on any of the component type: `Class`, `Pure`, `Function` all of them will re-render and this is **expected** behavior.

<Components isMemoized={false} changeProps={true} />

### Memoized components no props change

Components should be "memoized" to prevent re-rendering when no props have been changed.

The "memoziation" techniques described in the corresponding section of each component type.

The only `Pure` component has this functionality out of the box and no additional work for such component required.

<Components isMemoized={true} changeProps={false} />

### Memoized components props change

If **any prop has been changed** on any of the component type: `Class`, `Pure`, `Function` all of them will re-render even if they are "memoized" and this is **expected** behavior.

<Components isMemoized={true} changeProps={true} />
