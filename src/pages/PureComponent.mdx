## Pure Component

**Pure Component** - the [`React.PureComponent`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent) is similar to the `React.Component`. The difference between them is that `React.Component` doesn’t implement `shouldComponentUpdate()`, but `React.PureComponent` implements it with a **shallow prop and state comparison**.

If your React component’s `render()` function renders the same result given the same props and state, you can use `React.PureComponent` for a performance boost in some cases.

### Pure Component - Plain props

`Pure` component implements `shouldComponentUpdate()` with a **shallow prop and state comparison**.
That means no additional changes needed for the plain props.

```tsx
export class ChildPureComponent extends PureComponent<TValue> {
  // `Pure` component implements `shouldComponentUpdate()` with a **shallow prop and state comparison**.
  // That means no additional changes needed for the plain props.
  // ✅ Component does not re-render if parent component re-renders
  // but the props have not been changed.
  render() {
    return (
      <RenderCounter color="green">
        Child Pure Component: {this.props.value}
      </RenderCounter>
    );
  }
}
```

<PlainPropsPureComponent isMemoized={false} />

and it re-renders as expected, when props have been changes.

<PlainPropsPureComponent isMemoized={true} changeProps={true} />

### Pure Component - Object props

Passing objects as properties to the component are dangerous in terms of causing not wanted re-rendering.
If component needs to work only with subset of the object properties and none of them being changed,
the component still might re-render if any of the other property has changed.

Also, even if developer created the object and passes it as a parameter to the component,
it doesn't prevent other developers to add their own properties to the same object without
even knowing that it might have negative impact on re-rendering some other not related component.

```tsx
export type TObjectProps = {
  obj: TObjectValue;
};

export type TObjectValue = {
  num: number;
  str: string;
};
```

The component takes object properties as defined above:

```tsx
export class ChildPureComponentWithObjectProps extends PureComponent<TObjectProps> {
  render() {
    // The component only works with ✅ obj.str property and ignores ✅ obj.num
    // If parent component doesn't change the ✅ obj.str, but changes ⛔ obj.num
    // this component will still re-render 💣
    return (
      <RenderCounter color="red">
        Child Pure Component: {this.props.obj.str}
      </RenderCounter>
    );
  }
}
```

When parent component changes `obj.num` and doesn't change `obj.str`, the component
still re-renders. This happens, because `PureComponent` does a **shallow** comparison.

<ObjectPropsPureComponent isMemoized={false} />

> Note: the drawback of `PureComponent` with object props is, that if you change a value inside the object
> and not change the instance, the component may not re-render because it fails the shallow checks.

### Solution: Use plain props

The best solution is to use plain props and pass primitive values to the component.

```tsx
export class ChildPureComponentWithObjectProps extends PureComponent<{
  str: string;
}> {
  render() {
    // ✅ No object which can impact re-rendering
    return (
      <RenderCounter color="red">
        Child Pure Component: {this.props.str}
      </RenderCounter>
    );
  }
}
```
