## State Immutability in React, why it is important, and how to achieve it using Immer

React _props_ and _state_ are readonly by contract; it is, however, very easy to break this contract
and introduce issues that are difficult to debug. In order to prevent these issues it is advised not
to mutate state unless necessary. If non-trivial mutation of the current state is unvoidable, it is
advised to use an immutability helper called Immer.

In the text below we start with a piece of code
that doesn't work, we transform it into code that works, but is error-prone and unreadable, and eventually
we reach the state of well readable and easily maintainable code. As we go over these phases
we gradually build a case for using Immer.

### State mutation outside of setState mechanism

React _state_ is declared readonly, but that only means that the _reference_ to it is constant. This
effectively protects primitives from being changed, but it doesn't protect objects. The only sound
means of state change in React is the _setState_ method and any code that asserts it is correct in doing so.
In the example below, the _sumData_ function rightfully asserts that the state object will not change
and based on that it caches its output based on the state object's internal field "data".

```jsx
export const Component: React.FunctionComponent = props => {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState({ data: [0, 0] });

  // Assert state immutability.
  const data = state.data;
  const sumData = React.useCallback(
    () => data.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0),
    [data]
  );

  const run = () => {
    // State mutated.
    state.data = [1, 1];
    // Sum is out of sync.
    state.data.push(sumData());
    state.data.push(sumData());
    state.data.push(sumData());
    setState({ data: state.data });
  };
```

However, the _run_ function changes the state object -- its internal field _data_ now points to a
different address. _sumData_ captures the original address (that wasn't supposed to change), and therefore
it will sum the original data.

The logical step in rectifying this seems to be to make _sumData_ capture the entire state -- since it is
readonly we will be sure that we always refer to the correct address. It also seemingly makes sense not to construct
a new state object in _run_ since we only change a single field inside of it:

```jsx
export const Component: React.FunctionComponent = props => {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState({ data: [0, 0] });

  // Assert state immutability.
  const sumData = React.useCallback(
    () => state.data.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0),
    [state]
  );

  const run = () => {
    // State mutated.
    state.data = [1, 1];
    // Sum is in sync.
    state.data.push(sumData());
    state.data.push(sumData());
    state.data.push(sumData());
    setState(state);
  };
```

The issue with this change is that now it doesn't work at all, because React asserts that since the
address of the state object hasn't changed, the object itself hasn't changed, and it will ignore the
setState call. The obvious solution is to copy the object:

```jsx
export const Component: React.FunctionComponent = props => {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState({ data: [0, 0] });

  // Assert state immutability.
  const sumData = React.useCallback(
    () => state.data.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0),
    [state]
  );

  const run = () => {
    state.data = [1, 1];
    // Contract violation.
    state.data.push(sumData());
    state.data.push(sumData());
    state.data.push(sumData());
    setState({...state});
  };
```

Now the code will work. The issue with this code, however, is that it is breaking the immutability contract
with React and that it is prone to error. If the state object were to consist of multiple nested fields,
we would have to make sure that the object is copied properly to form a new state. Since there is no native
concept of "deep copy" in javascript, doing this can be rather cumbersome:

```jsx
export const Component: React.FunctionComponent = props => {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(getCumbersomeState());

  const getStateString = React.useCallback(() => JSON.stringify(state), [
    state
  ]);

  const updateJillsStreet = () => {
    // It is easy to get lost in this sea of spread operators and brackets.
    setState(prevState => ({
      people: [
        { ...prevState.people[0] },
        {
          ...prevState.people[1],
          addresses: [
            {
              ...prevState.people[1].addresses[0],
              street: `Street ${Math.random()}`
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }));
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div>{getStateString()}</div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={updateJillsStreet}>updateJillsStreet</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Immer.js to the rescue

And that is when Immer.js comes to the rescue. Immer.js uses ES6 proxies (note that when transcompiled to ES5
it will become much slower) to record changes to a so called _draft_ object during the execution of the _produce_
function and then project them onto a new object that becomes the new state. The _draft_ object is based on the existing
state that is passed to the _produce_ function along with the draft callback. The following snippet demonstrates
how we go from cumbersome, ugly, and ureadable to straightforward, beautiful, and well readable:

```jsx
export const Component: React.FunctionComponent = props => {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState(getCumbersomeState());

  const getStateString = React.useCallback(() => JSON.stringify(state), [
    state
  ]);

  const updateJillsStreet = () => {
    setState(
      produce(state, _draft => {
        _draft.people[1].addresses[0].street = `Street ${Math.random()}`;
      })
    );
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div>{getStateString()}</div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={updateJillsStreet}>updateJillsStreet</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This can be further simplified by using the _use-immer_ npm package that provides us with a hook
that combines the native _React.useState_ and Immer's _produce_:

```jsx
export const Component: React.FunctionComponent = props => {
  const [state, setState] = useImmer(getCumbersomeState());

  const getStateString = React.useCallback(() => JSON.stringify(state), [
    state
  ]);

  const updateJillsStreet = () => {
    setState(_draft => {
      _draft.people[1].addresses[0].street = `Street ${Math.random()}`;
    });
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div>{getStateString()}</div>
      <div>
        <button onClick={updateJillsStreet}>updateJillsStreet</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In the newly created state, fields that didn't change during the execution of the draft callback
will be referentially equal to the fields in the original state. Only fields that were changed
in the draft and the root object will be new objects.
