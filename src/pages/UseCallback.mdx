## useCallback

### Use `useCallback()` hook carefully, if you have a control on you children components

`useCallback()` hooks allows to keep references to created functions inside components, but it should be used only for callbacks are passed to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders (e.g. `shouldComponentUpdate`, `React.memo()`).

By default all React components do not use any update blockers, so there is no sense to force use `useCallback`
for every callback in your application:

<UselessUseCallback />

But, it makes sense to pass memoized callbacks to components that handle reference equality:

<ProperUseCallback />

### Children are out of your control

On the other hand, if you **don't know what children component might be**, it is worth to wrap your functions
with `useCallback()` hook. The operation itself is cheap and can prevent unwanted perf issues.

> If your function is new on each render, you might break some perf of your consumers.
> e.g. shouldComponentUpdate / useEffect
